### Group members

Jiawei Ye (jy2947), Yuxin Yang, Ruoyu Ji, Lingyu Zhang

### Motivation

The story starts on a peaceful weekend night, 100 Haven Avenue, Tower 3.

The fire alarm went off. AT 2A.M.

The residents were woken up from their sweet dreams and had to rush downstairs in bewilderment. Nothing seemed to be wrong in this building. No heat, no smoke. No sign of fire or danger.

The firemen arrived in minutes. The good news was they didn't need to risk their lives to rescue anyone from fire, the bad news was they still had to make sure nothing went wrong in this building at 2 o'clock in midnight.

But there was nothing wrong - except for an open door that should not be opened on the rooftop.

Someone began wondering - how often does incidents like this happen in NYC?

This is the very start of this final project.
