### Counts of Contributing Factors

We derive contributing factors from the "incident_type_desc" variable in the original dataset and filter out factors related to true fire alarms to make analysis more readily interpretable. And since our dataset is quite large in size, the table below only includes counts that are over 100.

### Barplot of Contributing Factors

Also, we can make the barplot for those factor counts, which may convey information more directly.

From the plot, we can see that the most common contributing factor for true fire alarms is "cooking fire, confined to container". Its count is 3 times more than that of the second factor "outside rubbish, trash or waste fire". Despite those two, factors like "building fire" and "trash or rubbish fire, contained" are frequently reported as well.
