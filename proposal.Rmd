###Motivation

The story starts on a peaceful weekend night, 100 Haven Avenue, Tower 3.  

The fire alarm went off. AT 2A.M. 

The residents were woken up from their sweet dreams and had to rush downstairs in bewilderment. Nothing seemed to be wrong in this building. No heat, no smoke. No sign of fire or danger.   

The firemen arrived in minutes. The good news was they didn't need to risk their lives to rescue anyone from fire, the bad news was they still had to make sure nothing went wrong in this building at 2 o'clock in midnight.  

But there was nothing wrong - except for an open door that should not be opened on the rooftop.  

Someone began wondering - how often does incidents like this happen in NYC? 

This is the very start of this final project.  

### The planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges
Planned analyses:  
The most common causes of fire incidents. 
The locations of the fire incidences by zip code area. 
The respond time of the fire department by zip code area. 
Use statistical models to analyze the factors associated with fire incidents and mortality. 
Possibly scrap the web for news of major fire incidence and “cross-validated” with the data we have. 

Visualizations: 
Maps: The area with the most fire incidences. The area with the fastest responses from the fire department. 
Bar chart - The most common causes of fire incidents. 

Coding challenges:
There are no coordinates of the exact location of the fire, so we have to use zip code or street names to visualize the incidence of fire. We currently do not know if it is easy to accomplish.
